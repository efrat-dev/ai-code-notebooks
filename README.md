# ai-code-notebooks

💻 **Executable code-first notebooks for AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science**  
Focused on practical implementation, hands-on experimentation, and algorithmic exploration.

---

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains a curated collection of Jupyter Notebooks focused on **practical coding** in AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science.  
Unlike theoretical summaries, these notebooks emphasize **working code**, examples, edge cases, and typical patterns used in real-world projects.

Designed as a **personal coding reference**, the notebooks are clean, modular, and documented to support experimentation, learning, and reuse.

## 🌐 Interactive Online Platform

An elegant and user-friendly web interface is available for exploring the notebooks:  
👉 [**Visit the AI Code Hub** »](https://efrat-dev.github.io/ai-code-notebooks/)

- Search functionality to quickly find relevant content  
- Open any notebook directly in **Google Colab**, **nbviewer**, or a built-in online viewer  
- Clean, aesthetic design for comfortable reading and navigation  

Explore the notebooks interactively, run code snippets, and learn with hands-on practice.

## 📂 Structure

- Each notebook focuses on a specific topic, library, or algorithm.
- Two versions may be included for each notebook:
  - `*.ipynb`: With code cells and output cells included.
  - `*-clean.ipynb`: With code only — no output cells.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

> *(Continuously growing — examples below)*

- `numpy` – Vectorization, broadcasting, numerical operations
- `pandas` – Data wrangling, groupby, time series
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Plotting and visualization
- `scikit-learn` – Classic ML models, pipelines, evaluation
- `pytorch` – Neural networks and deep learning
- `data-cleaning`, `EDA`, `feature-engineering`
- And more…

---

## ✅ Intended For

- Developers seeking reference notebooks with runnable code
- Learners who prefer coding-first approaches
- Practitioners who need modular examples of core ML/AI workflows

---

## 📝 Notes

- Most notebooks are written with clarity and reusability in mind.
- All outputs are reproducible; randomness is controlled with seeds when needed.
